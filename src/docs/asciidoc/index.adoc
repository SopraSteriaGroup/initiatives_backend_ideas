[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

The *Initiatives ideas API* tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `401 Unauthorized`
| The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource

| `403 Forbidden`
| The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server considers them insufficient to grant access

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| The type of request for this resource is not allowed. For example, some endpoints may be GET only. Trying a POST will return this message

| `409 Conflict`
| The requested resource is conflicting with the current state of the server. Conflicts are most likely to occur when an older already exists

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object that describes the problem.
The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/conflictCreateIdea/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to create an Idea with a name that exists already will produce a `409 Conflict` response:

include::{snippets}/conflictCreateIdea/http-response.adoc[]
